# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation! This guide serves as your central resource for understanding how we plan, execute, and deliver projects with clarity, accountability, and continuous improvement.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management process emphasizes clarity, accountability, and adaptability to enable consistent, high-quality delivery across cross-functional teams. Whether you're a new team member or a seasoned contributor, this documentation will help you understand our workflows, roles, and best practices.

### Key Workflows

Our projects follow a structured lifecycle with five distinct phases:

- **Initiation**: We begin by validating business need, clarifying objectives, identifying key stakeholders, and authorizing work. This phase ensures every project starts with a clear purpose and proper alignment.

- **Planning**: Work is broken down into shippable increments, responsibilities are aligned, and dependencies and risks are identified. We establish timelines through collaborative backlog refinement and estimation sessions.

- **Execution and Tracking**: Daily progress is measured through standups and sync meetings to maintain team rhythm and surface risks early. We emphasize agile practices like small, reviewable pull requests and clear adherence to acceptance criteria and Definition of Done.

- **Release and Deployment**: Releases follow strict pre-release checks including CI verification, stakeholder signoff, backup planning, and clear communication of release notes.

- **Retrospective**: After major milestones or incidents, we capture learnings, follow up on action items, and ensure continuous improvement is built into our culture.

### Core Personas and Roles

Clear ownership drives accountability. Each project assigns specific roles with concrete responsibilities:

- **Project Managers**: Coordinate delivery, manage risks, and facilitate communication across teams
- **Product Managers**: Define outcomes, set priorities, and ensure alignment with business objectives
- **Developers**: Build features, write quality code, and participate in technical decision-making
- **QA Engineers**: Ensure quality through automated testing, security scanning, and manual reviews
- **UX Designers**: Conduct user research, create prototypes, and ensure intuitive user experiences
- **DevOps Engineers**: Build CI/CD pipelines, automate processes, and maintain reliable infrastructure
- **Security Leads**: Conduct security reviews, assess threats, and coordinate incident response
- **Customer Success / Support**: Gather user feedback, triage issues, and communicate with customers
- **Stakeholders**: Provide input, feedback, and signoff at key decision points

Every project and feature has a designated owner, ensuring focus and accountability from setup through delivery. Clear handoff points between roles ensure smooth collaboration throughout the project lifecycle.

### Communication Strategies and Cadences

Communication is embedded at every level:

- **Daily Standups**: Delivery teams synchronize on progress, blockers, and next steps
- **Weekly Syncs**: Project leadership reviews status, risks, and upcoming milestones
- **Milestone Updates**: Regular stakeholder communications ensure visibility and alignment
- **Escalation Paths**: Codified processes ensure blockers are addressed at the appropriate level, from team to executive sponsors

Documentation—such as project charters, risk registers, and retrospectives—serves as both a reference and living artifact, facilitating transparent decision-making and smooth onboarding.

### Quality Assurance Practices

Quality is an integral, ongoing activity rather than a late-stage gate:

- **Automated Testing**: Built into the pull request process to catch issues early
- **Security Scanning**: Continuous security checks ensure vulnerabilities are identified and addressed
- **Manual QA Reviews**: Critical flows and features receive hands-on testing and validation
- **Pre-Release Checks**: Comprehensive verification before any release goes live

Workflows are built on standard boards like GitHub Projects, emphasizing small, reviewable changes that meet clear acceptance criteria.
